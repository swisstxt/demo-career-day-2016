# Ansible Cloud Project [name]

## Description
...

## Keep this project in sync with the boilerplate

Since this project is based on the [ansible-cloud-project-boilerplate](https://github.com/swisstxt/ansible-cloud-project-boilerplate)
it is recommended to update the boilerplated files from time to time. To do so...

1. ... keep in mind not to edit the files that are provided by the boilerplate.
2. ... run `./boilerplate sync`. This will update the boilerplate files as well as update all git submodules.
